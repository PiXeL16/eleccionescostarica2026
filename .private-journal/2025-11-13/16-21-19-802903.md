## Project Notes

Today we completed comprehensive documentation updates for the Elecciones2026 project to reflect all the AI chat features we built:

## Major Documentation Updates:

### README.md
- Added AI-Powered Chat section with 8 detailed feature bullets
- Updated Technologies section (split into Frontend/Build, Data/AI, UI Components)
- Changed architecture from "Two-Stage" to "Three-Stage Pipeline" to include embedding generation
- Updated "Static Export" to "Hybrid Architecture: Static + Dynamic"
- Added environment variable configuration section for OPENAI_API_KEY and PostHog
- Updated database structure to document vector embeddings and search indexes
- Added detailed "AI Chat Feature" section explaining RAG workflow
- Updated current status to mention 2,000 embedded pages
- Added generate_embeddings.py to pipeline usage examples
- Moved chat features from "Future" to "Completed" section

### IDEAS.md
- Created new "Recently Completed (November 2025)" section
- Documented full AI chat feature set with technical details
- Marked Smart Search as completed via AI Chat
- Updated filtering section to note it's on hold pending data quality

## Technical Features Documented:
1. Semantic search with RAG pattern
2. Vector embeddings using text-embedding-3-small
3. sqlite-vec extension for similarity search
4. Adaptive chunking strategy (1500-3500 chars)
5. Streaming responses with Vercel AI SDK
6. Multi-party comparison support
7. Source attribution with page numbers
8. PostHog feature flags
9. Hybrid static/dynamic architecture

## Key Files Reviewed:
- /web/app/api/chat/route.ts - Streaming chat API with semantic search
- /web/components/ChatSidebar.tsx - Full-featured chat UI component
- /web/lib/chat-data.ts - Semantic search and embedding functions
- /pipeline/scripts/generate_embeddings.py - Embedding generation script

The documentation now accurately reflects the sophisticated AI-powered search and chat system we've built, making it clear this is no longer just a static comparison site but a full RAG-powered Q&A platform.
