## Project Notes

Elecciones2026 project now uses Bun.serve() instead of nginx for static file serving. The Dockerfile still uses Node.js in the builder stage because better-sqlite3 needs to be compiled for Node to work with Next.js during the build process. The final production stage uses Bun's Alpine image.

The server.ts file implements all the same features that were in nginx.conf:
- Security headers
- Cache-Control for different asset types
- SPA routing
- 404 handling

The project is deployed to Coolify, which triggers via GitHub Actions webhook after building and pushing the Docker image to GHCR.
