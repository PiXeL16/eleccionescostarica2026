## Project Notes

Elecciones2026 - Feature Implementation Update:

Completed Ideological Spectrum Map (Feature #2):

What I Built:
- ideology-analyzer.ts: Keyword-based analysis to calculate economic (left-right) and social (progressive-conservative) scores for each party
- IdeologySpectrumMap.tsx: Interactive scatter plot using Recharts showing all 20 parties on 2D ideological axes
- Added getAllPartiesWithPositions() to database.ts for efficient data retrieval
- Extended party-colors.ts with hex color mappings for chart visualizations

Technical Details:
- Economic analysis: Keywords for state intervention vs. free market (50+ keywords)
- Social analysis: Keywords for progressive vs. conservative positions (40+ keywords)
- Confidence scoring based on keyword match frequency
- Recharts ScatterChart with custom tooltips, interactive dots, reference lines
- Mobile-responsive with informative legend and interpretation guide

Lessons Learned:
- Tailwind color classes don't work in Recharts - need hex colors
- getPartyColors existed but returned CSS classes, created getPartyColor() for hex values
- Server component in Next.js allows calculating ideology scores at build time (no client overhead)
- Keyword-based approach is simple but effective for initial positioning

Next Steps:
- Could enhance with LLM-based scoring for more nuanced analysis
- Add "Where am I?" feature for user self-positioning
- Consider caching ideology scores in database for performance

Build Status: ✅ Compiled successfully, no errors
